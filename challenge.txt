Answer: Use python and tabula to make a csv

Clean the CSV so that it's useful
use something like a regex to filter out the bad lines

Add a unique primary key to each record
i=0; for line in `cat cleaned.csv`; do ((i++)); echo "$i, $line"; done

Turn the data into JSON with the following fields for each record, with an appropriate data type. When doing this, add a unique primary key to each record using whatever method you would prefer.
- type -> Permit Type
- date1 -> Preferred Entry Date 1
- date2 ->  Preferred Entry Date 2
- date3 -> Preferred Entry Date 3
- zone1 -> Preferred Zone 1
- zone2 -> Preferred Zone 2
- zone3 -> Preferred Zone 3
- awarded -> Result Status
- awardPref -> Awarded Preference
- awardDate -> Awarded Entrance Date
- awardZone -> Awarded Entrance Code / Zone
- awardSize -> Awarded Group Size

For instance, you may have this record in your JSON:
    "9": {
        "type": "Overnight Permit",
        "date1": "7/20/2020",
        "zone1": "Colchuck Zone",
        "date2": "7/22/2020",
        "zone2": "Colchuck Zone",
        "date3": "7/21/2020",
        "zone3": "Colchuck Zone",
        "awarded": "Awarded",
        "awardPref": "1",
        "awardDate": "7/20/2020",
        "awardZone": "Colchuck Zone",
        "awardSize": "4"
    },
